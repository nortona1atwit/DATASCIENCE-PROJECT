# Introduction

#### Data Science Project by Aidan Norton <br>
In this project, we will look at the sport of powerlifting. We will aim to answer the following three questions: <br>
- How is an individuals bodyweight correlated to their max bench press?
- Are Males/Females Relatively Better at a Given Exercise Compared to one Another?
- Is using Equipment Shown to be Significantly Helpful for Lifts?
### Powerlifting

Powerlifting is a competitive sport where each competitor gives their all to lift as much weight as they can with 1 repetition. <br>
There are three main exercises in powerlifting that are staples in measuring one's strength:
- Squat
- Deadlift
- Bench Press <br>
Each individual who performs at a powerlifting meet primarily performs at least a couple of these exercises. Each exercise is performed usually 3 times, and each participant's score is their best lift out of those few. <br> Whoever can lift the most weight combined across the three exercises in their weight/age class is regarded as the winner. <br>
### Dataset
We have a dataset consisting of hundreds of thousands of records of individuals' performance at powerlifting meets. <br>
There are many columns that record information about each participant's performance, such as their age, sex, weight, bench press, deadlift, squat; this dataset is an aggregation of many powerlifting meets across many years, so there is also information about the powerlifting meet dates, location, and event names. <br>
We will finally filter the squat/deadlift/bench records to focus only on the best out of three for each participant who went to meets that scored based on 3 attempts for each.
